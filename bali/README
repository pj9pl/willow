Bali is an application for the ATmega328P microcontroller.
It provides access to the internal devices from the outside world.

It is connected to the internal devices via the TWI.

The linux development environment uses four terminals referred to
as SEND, RECV, MAKE and AUX.

     --------------------
     |  SEND  |   MAKE  |
     --------------------
     |  AUX   |   RECV  |
     --------------------

These are all situated in the bali working directory and have exported $tmpdir,
$port, $PORT and $logfileprefix to their environment by executing:-

     . ./defs.sh

Bali's green button activates the HC-05 Bluetooth adapter into pairing mode
for 30 seconds. During this period, establish a connection by whatever means
your Bluetooth manager provides.


In the SEND terminal execute:-

      bt_tee_sender.sh 

In the RECV terminal execute:-

      bt_tee_receiver.sh

Filters can tail -f the file being accumulated in ../tmp.

To reprogram the application in bali:-
 - Ensure the bootloader switch is closed.
 - Quit bt_tee_receiver.sh so that avrdude can read the incoming data.
 - If bali is in CLI mode enter 'reboot self' into the SEND terminal
   whereas if bali is in INP mode enter 'q' into the SEND terminal.
   Alternatively press the RESET (red) button.
   The mode can be checked by entering 'e' into the SEND terminal.
   - INP mode will print e.g. '# bali ivy-10-g0ba5b93 Dec 20 2023 09:21:31'
   - CLI mode will print e.g. 'e :  bad command'.
 - Enter 'make flash' into the MAKE terminal.

If avrdude succeeds, the updated application will now be running and
bt_tee_receiver.sh can again be run in the RECV terminal. It will be in INP
mode. This can be confirmed be entering 'e' into the SEND terminal which
prints the ident in the RECV terminal.
