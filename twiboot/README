  This directory contains a modified version of the twiboot bootloader
  by Olaf Rempel (razzor@kopf-tisch.de) derived from:-
    https://github.com/orempel/twiboot
       git description: v3.0-5-g559a403
       date: 2021-02-20 20:56:26


  To build twiboot.hex, type:-
    make I2C_ADDRESS=i2c_address MCU=device F_CPU=hertz \
                                           BOOTLOADER_START=mem_address

  substituting i2c_address, device, hertz and mem_address with actual values
  for example:-
    make I2C_ADDRESS=FIDO_I2C_ADDRESS MCU=atmega328p F_CPU=8000000 \
                                                BOOTLOADER_START=0x7C00

  The usual method is to execute 'make image' from within one of the
  application directories, which provides the appropriate arguments
  and incorporates the hex file into the application image.
