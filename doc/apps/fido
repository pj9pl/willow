  FIDO

  Fido is a host at i2c address 0x40,0x41 (64,65 decimal).
  It manages a number of iterative process directors.

  It manages the RV-3028-C7 real time clock.
  To adjust the RTC:-

    1. In the AUX terminal (lower left):-
            trailer.sh|vtime # decode and print arriving TIME records

    2. In the SEND terminal (upper left):-
            inp fido 1z      # redirect TTY output to the OSTREAM destination
            inp fido 3u      # print UTC drift relative to RTC.
            inp fido 1u      # enable RTC one second periodic interrupt
            inp fido 2u      # enable RTC sixty second periodic interrupt
            inp fido j       # print RTC on the periodic interrupt
            inp fido k       # print UTC on the periodic interrupt

    Measure the discrepancy between the printed time and the Klik clock by ear
            inp fido r       # print the current adjustment value
            inp fido 255R    # maximum advance (if RTC is slow)
            inp fido -255R   # maximum retard (if RTC is fast)
            inp fido 1h      # update the UTC with the adjusted UNIXTIME

    Observe the millisecond value alterations on successive interrupts
    where it increases as the RTC is retarded, or decreases as the RTC
    is advanced. The maximum adjustment is 4ms per 16 seconds.

    When the printed time is in sync with the Klik clock:-
            inp fido 1h      # update the UTC with the adjusted UNIXTIME
            inp fido -1R     # reduce the offset value to the default
