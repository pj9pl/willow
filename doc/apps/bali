  BALI

  Bali is a host at i2c address 0x3C,0x3D (60,61 decimal).
  It manages a cli, icsp and isp.

  It has an 11.06 MHz ceramic resonator.
  The Low Fuse Byte is programmed to 0xCF [p.292-3] to select the Low Power
  Crystal Oscillator as the Clock Source between 8.0 and 16.0 MHz with slowly
  rising power[p.38-9].

  Note that the Full Swing Crystal Oscillator is not supported [p.654].

  It has a BC417 HC-05 Bluetooth adaptor with the baudrate set to 115200.

  It has an ICSP output in addition to an ICSP input.

  It has a serial bootloader with the baudrate at 115200.
  The High Fuse Byte is programmed to 0xDA for a 2k bootsize from 0x7800.

  It provides the primary interface to the outside world via a HC-05 Bluetooth
  interface that accepts lines of text, either as commands or structured data.

  It is used to reprogram the internal devices, either with in-system
  programming using avril(1), or with in-circuit serial programming using
  avp(1). It cannot reprogram itself, avrdude(1) being used to reprogram the
  application part, and the secondary interface provided by iowa being used
  to reprogram the bootloader using in-circuit serial programming.
