  OSLO

  Oslo is a host at i2c address 0x34,0x35 (52,53 decimal).

  It manages an SD-HC card, a 32768 Hz watch crystal and a voltage
  input on ADC channel 0. The attenuator feeding ADC0 divides by 6.75,
  which corresponds to a maximum voltage of 22 volts.

  It uses the internal 8MHz clock.
  The low fuse is programmed to 0xE2.

  There are two 512 byte buffers permanently allocated within the SRAM,
  named admin and datum. The FSD task always uses the admin buffer and
  the RWR task always uses the datum buffer. This is to allow a write
  request to be serviced whilst a read request is underway.
