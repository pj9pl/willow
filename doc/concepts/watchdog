  WATCHDOG

  The watchdog timer [p.60] is used to reset the device if a task does
  not complete the processing of a message within a specified period.

  If a particular operation may exceed the timeout limit, a task may disable
  the watchdog timer. For example the blank check operation in the HVPP task.

  The watchdog timer is disabled during idle mode whilst waiting for a message
  to arrive. The interrupt context is not protected during this state.

  The watchdog interrupt can be enabled by #defining WDT_DUMP to a non-zero
  value in [app]/host.h. This is configured in sys/msg.c to dump the SRAM to
  the USART0 peripheral.
