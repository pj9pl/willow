  ADDING NEW TASKS

  Adding another task to a host requires modifications to
     Makefile

        ...
        istream.o \
        ...

     main.c

        ...
        #include "net/istream.h"
        ...
        [ISTREAM] = process_istream,
        ...
        config_istream();
        ...

     host.h

        ...
        ISTREAM,
        ...


  If the task requires dynamic initialization
     sysinit.c

        ...
        ISTREAM,
        ...

  will also need
  to be modified. If it needs control input inp.c may need to be modified.

  If the task declares a pre-start init function this should be called from
  within main.c in the pre-start init section.
