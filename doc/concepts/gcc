  GCC

  The Willow system itself uses compound literals, designated initializers,
  long longs, flexible array members, the __flash qualifier, binary constants
  and the ((unused)) and ((packed)) __attribute__ statements.

  The Optiboot bootloader uses the ((naked)) and ((section)) __attribute__
  statements.

  These are supported by avr-gcc 7.3.0 which is provided with arduino-1.8.10.
  The raspberry pi installs avr-gcc 5.4.0 which is provided with arduino-1.8.13

  Designated initializers are required to ensure that the proctab[] members are
  assigned in ProcNumber order. Maintaining this correspondance manually would
  be a liability.

  Non-trivial designated initializers not supported by avr-g++ (GCC) 7.3.0.

  avr-g++ doesn't recognise the __flash qualifier, as in:-

      static const MsgProc __flash proctab[] = {

  but does accept the PROGMEM __attribute__:-

      static const MsgProc proctab[] PROGMEM = {

  Both produce the same binary code.
