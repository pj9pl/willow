  WILLOW

    Willow is an application framework for the ATmega328P microcontroller.

    It provides single-threaded cooperative multitasking based on message
    passing finite state machines.
 
    It consists of modules that each export a receive function which is
    called from the main loop with a pointer to the message being delivered.

    Cooperative multitasking is explicit, in that a task must yield after
    sending a message in order for that message to be delivered.
 
    There is no preemptive scheduling. Each task decides for itself how
    long it will retain control of the application context.

    Each message is processed to completion before the receive function
    returns to the main loop.

    The three kinds of message are request, reply and notification.
    A request begets a reply.

    A task can send a request knowing that a reply will be received later.
    This enables a task to perform a given operation in stages, where each
    stage performs an action and sends a message.  When a reply is received
    the operation is resumed at a point determined by the state.
