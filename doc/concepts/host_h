  HOST_H

  The [app]/host.h header file contains definitions specific to the
  application. By its inclusion in sys/msg.h it is visible to all tasks.

  It specifies which timer is to be used for the alarm clock (CLK) and
  enumerats each task that is used by the app.

  Where the USART0 baudrate is other than B9600, e.g. (pisa):-
  #define DEFAULT_BAUDRATE B57600

  To dump the SRAM out of the USART0 peripheral if the Watchdog timer
  expires, #define WDT_DUMP to a non-zero value.

  If the order of the ProcNumber enum matches that of the objects in
  Makefile then the list-bss output will correlate with the task ID.
