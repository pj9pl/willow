  APPS

  An app is a single image written to a specific MCU.

  It compiles library files according to its own definitions.

  Manifest.

  Tha app directory contains the source files that differ in some way that
  cannot be shared with other apps.

  The lib directory contains files that can be shared with other apps.

  Using GNU make, the vpath definition enables a *.c file in the app
  directory to override a *.c file with the same name in the lib directory,
  This allows a bespoke version to be built in preference to a generic
  version in the library, whilst in the absence of a bespoke file, the generic
  version in the library is selected.

  This is convenient if print statements are added, where other hosts need not
  be disturbed.

  Each app has:-
    host.h
    inp.c
    main.c
    Makefile
    README
    README.commands
    syscon.c
    sysinit.c
    ver.c

  Additionally, an external host has:-

    cli.c
    defs.sh
