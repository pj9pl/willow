  BLUETOOTH

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BlueZ 5 compatibility fix:-
  As root,
  1. Edit /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service to add --compat to the
     bluetooth daemon args:-
          < ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd
          > ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --compat
 
  2. run:-
      systemctl daemon-reload 
      systemctl restart bluetooth
      chmod 777 /var/run/sdp

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The serial port profile is used to connect a linux host to a HC-05 adapter.

  Four terminals are currently used to communicate with bali's HC-05:-
          ---------------------------------
          |               |               |
          |     send      |      make     |
          |               |               |
          |---------------|---------------|
          |               |               |
          |      aux      |    receive    |
          |               |               |
          ---------------------------------
  In all four terminals, change to the willow/bali directory and run:-

     . ./defs.sh

  This exports the /dev/rfcommN used with bali's HC-05 to the environment
  as $port.

  Linux Bluetooth

  Following a linux reboot, the /dev/rfcommN character special files need to be
  recreated.  The Xfce GUI method is what I have been using so far.

   - Click on the Bluetooth logo in the system tray. Click on the 'Devices..'
     menu item. This should open the Bluetooth Devices dialog.

   - If the HC-05 LED is not flashing at all, press bali's green button to 
     wake it up and set the HC-05 LED flashing at ~2Hz, 50% duty cycle,
     indicating that it is in pairing mode.

   - In the Bluetooth Devices dialog, right-click on the Bali device and select
     'Connect to serial port' from the menu.

   - When a connection is established, close the Bluetooth Devices dialog.

   This connection lasts until the HC-05 adapter is next deactivated.
   The corresponding /dev/rfcomm[0..N] file can be opened and closed without
   causing a disconnection.
 
     Once the HC-05 has been deactivated, the 'behind-the-scenes' connection
     is obsolete. Upon reactivation, the HC-05 LED flashes at ~2Hz 
     and the bt_tee_sender.sh is used to establish the bt_tee_sender.sh script
     from within bali's working directory, as decribed below.

     After this grace period, the bt_tee_sender.sh is run whilst the HC-05 LED
     is flashing rapidly, indicating that it is in pairing mode. This should
     achieve a connection, whereupon the bt_tee_receiver.sh can be run in the
     receiver terminal.

   - If linux is restarted, this procedure will need to be repeated.

  --

  If need be, press bali's  green (WAKEUP) pushbutton to start the HC-05
  flashing, in which case it will time-out after 30 seconds of being
  unconnected.

  Run the bt_tee_sender.sh script from within the sender terminal.
  This establishes a connection and also create an output file in willow/tmp
  containing both sides of the exchange. If the connection fails, try again.

  Once a connection has been established, run the bt_tee_receiver.sh script in
  the receiver terminal. This will receive incoming data and append it to the
  file that bt_tee_sender.sh just created.

  Note that if bt_tee_sender.sh is stopped and restarted, a new tmp file will
  be created, and bt_tee_receiver.sh will need to be restarted to append to the
  new file.

  AT Command Mode.

  The adapter connected to pisa has had the NAME changed to pisa and the UART
  changed to 57600,0,0. There is still some confusion regarding the non-output
  of some AT commands, mainly GET commands. For example, setting the name using
       print <host> AT+NAME=pisa
  produces
       OK
  but getting the name using
       print <host> AT+NAME?
  or
       print <host> AT+NAME
  produces nothing.

  Whereas getting the UART parameters using
       print <host> AT+UART?
  or
       print <host> AT+UART
  produces
       +UART:57600,0,0

       OK

  The name 'pisa' appears instead of 'HC-05' in both the Android app and the
  linux Blueman-manager.

  The '3d' inp command is very much faster, suggesting that the baud rate has
  been increased.

  p.s.
    For some unknown reason, the Acer Chromebook (camel) has changed its
    behavior. The connection needs pairing each time after Zara is switched
    off. It didn't do this previously.

    The RPi is worse, in that it does not connect between the Belkin USB
    Bluetooth dongle and a HC-05 adapter.

    The Acer Chromebook problems started after playing with the RPi.
    Coincidence or causal link?
