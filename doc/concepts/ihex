  00 Program Data
      :nnaaaa00dd....ddcc
      Where
         nn       = number of data bytes in record
         00       = "Program Data" command
         aaaa     = memory address of first byte in record
         dd....dd = data bytes
         cc       = checksum

      Example:
         :103C00000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0FC4

  01 End of File (EOF), no operation
      :00xxxx01cc
      Where
          00   = number of data bytes in record
          xxxx = don't care
          cc   = checksum

     Example:
          :00000001FF

  04 EXTENDED LINEAR ADDRESS, 0x0081 equates to EEPROM segment
      :02xxxx04aaaacc
      Where
          02   = number of data bytes in record
          aaaa = Upper linear base address.

      Example:
