  - The system can be halted by an aberrent task.

  - It is neither object-oriented nor object based. Each task is primarily
    referenced by a receive function rather than an instance of a class.

  - It is non portable. The code has been developed using a number of
    ATmega328P devices, and as a consequence is little-endian. It has
    only been tested with ATmega328P devices. The third-party bootloaders
    have been edited to remove conditional code for other devices, in the
    interests of clarity.

  - It only runs tasks. Aside from the main function, the message mechanism,
    the stopwatch and the core dump module, everything is contained within
    task modules. 

  - The operation is not foolproof. There are many ways in which the unwary may
    be thwarted. Reprogramming is one operation which is fraught with hazards,
    and may surely fail if another device were to send the target a request
    during the proceedings.

  - Only 7-bit ASCII characters are supported. There is no provision for
    Unicode or any other charsets.
