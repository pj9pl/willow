  BOARDS

    Stripboard is easy to use. Edges should be smooth. Clean tracks
    are essential. Isopropyl alcohol, cotton buds and a fiberglass
    pencil (RS: 514-868) should be used.

    Single strand 0.6mm hookup wire (Cricklewood: WP16) maintains
    its shape and provides strain relief. Connections are insulated
    using 1mm silicone sleeving (RS: 399-401).

    A ring topology may reduce the voltage drop at the furthest point
    from the power supply. Whilst a ring has no ends to cause reflections
    without correct termination impedance, there may be ringing at some
    resonant frequency.

    Each board has two flying leads terminated with a 9 pin D-Type.
    Male for the input, female for the output.

    A board with a HC-05 adaptor has red and green buttons and a switch.
    A board without a HC-05 has one black button and a switch.
    The red or black button performs an external reset.
    The green button energises a deactivated HC-05 into Pairing Mode
    for 30 seconds.

    The 5v rail feeds the HC-05 adaptors and the LCD backlight.

    The HC-05 current consumption is ~45mA during Pairing Mode.
    The consumption increases with a higher baud rate, with 115200
    consuming ~36mA.

    This burden justifies its own 3.3v regulator fed from the 5v rail.

    The switch is a two position sliding type. While the switch is
    closed an external reset causes the bootloader to be entered.

    An external host uses optiboot whereas an internal host uses twiboot.

    The system clock source is normally configured to use the internal
    RC oscillator at 8MHZ.

    The factory default setting of CKDIV8 needs to be unprogrammed by
    changing bit 7 of the Low Fuse Byte from low to high as in 0x62 to
    0xE2 [p.292].

    A 3-pin 11.06 MHz ceramic resonator (RS: 728-8474) is fitted to
    some boards in order to achieve a baudrate of 115200. This requires
    the Low Fuse Byte to be programmed to 0xCF [p.39,292] and F_CPU
    defined as 11059200 Hz.

    The extrapolated maximum clock frequency at 3.3v being ~13 MHz [p.312].
