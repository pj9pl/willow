  AVRIL

  avril is used to reprogram the application section of an internal host that
  has twiboot installed in the bootloader section. It communicates with bali
  from within the bali working directory.

  Export $port to the environment using:-
     . ./defs.sh

  Exit the bt_tee_receiver.sh script in the receiving terminal so that avril
  can read the bluetooth input.

  Run the program:-
     avril hostname [hostname ...]

  avril loads an application image onto an internal host using ISP hosted on
  bali. The hexfile must contain a series of IHEX_DATA_RECORDs with an
  IHEX_EXTENDED_LINEAR_ADDRESS_RECORD preceeding any eeprom data, terminated
  by an IHEX_END_OF_FILE_RECORD.

  It is operated from bali's source directory where the environment specifies
  bali's HC-05 adaptor and the hexfile path begins with '../'.

  There is always the potential to write the wrong hexfile to the wrong host.
  It is therefore standard procedure to name the directory and the hexfile
  to by the hostname, so that a hexfile can be easily identified.
  The current format is 'hostname/hostname.hex'

  The bluetooth port and the baudrate can be set in the environment as:-
     $port and $baud

  Errors

    - if it hangs and 'closed' or 'open' appears on the receiving terminal,
      the bt_tee_receiver.sh is reading the response instead of avril.
      Quit bt_tee_receiver.sh and avril then try again.

    - if you get expected 'TWIBOOT', got 'newline'
      then when you reconnect the bt_tee_receiver.sh you see:- cli: error 11
      first check that the bootloader switch is closed.  

    - $port must be set in the environment, to something like /dev/rfcomm0.

    - A frequent cause of failure is the target receiving a message from
      another host whilst being reprogrammed.

    - If the progression halts during the programming operation, gander(1)
      may be used to perform the operation, for example with pisa:
         - reset the target.
         - enter 'isp pisa' in the sending terminal, and observe:
                          TWIBOOT v3.2c
                          1E950F807C000400
           in the receiving terminal.
         - quit the bt_tee_receiver.sh script in the receiving terminal.
         - execute 'gander -f ../pisa/pisa.hex'
