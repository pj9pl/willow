  AVP

  avp is used to reprogram an ATmega328P with ICSP or HVPP.

  usage: avp [-p port]
             [-k lockbits]
             [-l lowfuses]
             [-h highfuses]
             [-e extendedfuses] 
             [-r flash_readbackfilename] 
             [-s eeprom_readbackfilename] 
             [-c] chip erase
             [file.hex]

  Lockbits, lowfuses, highfuses and extendedfuses are specified using two
  hexadecimal characters prefixed with '0x'.

  The lock bits and extended fuses remain unprogrammed.
  The fuse values are described in the ATmega328P datasheet on pages 275-293.

  The low fuses differ only in the system clock:-
       0xCF - 11.06 MHz external resonator
       0xE2 - 8 MHz internal RC osc

  The high fuses differ only in the bootloader size:-
       0xDC - twiboot 1024 bytes start at 7C00
       0xDE - optiboot 512 bytes start at 7E00

  Example 1. 11.06 MHz external resonator, optiboot bootloader:-
  $ avp -l 0xCF -h 0xDE -r readback.hex ../bali/image.hex

  Example 2. 8 MHz RC internal oscillator, twiboot bootloader:-
  $ avp -l 0xE2 -h 0xDC -r readback.hex ../fido/image.hex

  Example 3. 11.06 MHz external resonator, twiboot bootloader:-
  $ avp -l 0xCF -h 0xDC -r readback.hex ../iowa/image.hex
