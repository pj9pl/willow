  FTIME

  Ftime is a linux program to compare the RV-3028-C7 RTC with the
  linux ntp time.

  It is executed in the auxiliary terminal and reads the Bluetooth
  serial input.

  The bt_tee_receiver.sh script must be exited to allow ftime to read
  the Bluetooth serial input.

  In the auxiliary terminal, type:-

      ftime 2>&1 |tee -a ftime.out

  In the send terminal, type:-

      inp fido 1z
      inp fido r
      inp fido k
      inp fido 1u
      inp fido 2u
      inp fido 0u

  There is a discrepancy between per-minute and per-second intervals
  of about 85 milliseconds which might be explained by the HC-05
  having to be powered-up each minute, whereas it's still awake after
  only one second.
