  IOTA

  The IOTA task is a driver for a No-Name 128x64 1.3" OLED screen containing
  an SH1106. It is connected via the i2c interface described in SH1106.pdf on
  page 21.

  The actual device bears no manufacturer mark.
  The SET_SEGMENT_REMAP command has no effect on the current display.
  Subsequent data is written in the new orientation.

  It is hosted on lima.

  It assumes the alias of OLED.

  This display RAM can be read and is used as a 2x512 data buffer between EGOR
  on pisa and HILDA on oslo. The 132 bytes in a page leave 4 bytes available
  for other purposes. This could include left and right calipers, or ownership
  amongst clients. There are two invisible bytes at either end.
