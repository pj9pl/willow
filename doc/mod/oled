  OLED

  The OLED task is a jobbing server that manages an OLED display device.
  Two slightly different devices are implemented by iota.c and viola.c which
  provide a generic OLED interface.

  It is defined in [app]/host.h:-

    typedef enum {
        ...
        OLED,
        ...
    } __attribute__((packed)) ProcNumber;

  and the association is made with the actual server in [app]/main.c:-

    static const MsgProc __flash proctab[] = {
        ...
        [OLED] = process_viola,         /* generic */
        ...
    };
