  BC3

  The BC3 task manages a ZS_040 BC352 HC-05 Bluetooth adapter.
  It provides a HC05 client interface. 

  There are two of these items:-
     98:D3:A1:F5:CD:D0
     98:D3:71:F5:EF:91  BC352 239AU K005BH
     
  The BC352 doesn't have a VREG_EN input, so the HC05_ENABLE signal
  emanating from PORTD5 (pin #11) controls an external +5v VDD switch:-
     low = off
     high = on

  The HC05_KEY signal emanating from PORTD2 (pin #4) is fed into the pin
  marked EN:-
     low | undriven = transparent UART
     high = AT_MODE
