  KEYSEC

  The KEYSEC task is a network secretary that receives a KEY_REQUEST 
  OP_LOADKEY message from any task, which instructs KEYCONF to load a
  particular key config file, specified by inode number.

  When the reply from KEYCONF is received, KEYSEC sends a KEY_REPLY message
  with the result and the number of lines processed to the HOST:TASK:JOB that
  sent the KEY_REQUEST.

  The key config files are stored in the /key directory. The file /key/basic
  contains default settings. The CLI command 'key <path>' resolves the path
  and sends KEYSEC a KEY_REQUEST OP_LOADKEY message with the inode number.
