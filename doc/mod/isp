  ISP

  The ISP task is an in-system programmer acting as a twiboot proxy for
  internal hosts. It is hosted on bali.

  ISP accepts an aligned Intel hex file, in that each record up to the final
  one contains 16 data btes. This alignment is achieved by using Motorola srec
  as an intermediate format in the make process.

  The native Intel format produced by avr-objcopy can contain a data record
  which spans two SPM pages causing ISP to fail.

  The host's bootloader switch must be closed for it to be reprogrammed using
  avril.

  The reprogramming may fail if the target receives a request from another
  host during the operation.
  
  To reprogram peru from within the bali source directory, type:-

  Multiple hosts can be given to avril:-
