  ALBA

  The ALBA task is an SPI driver for an AD7124-8 device.

  In addition to JOB requests, A client may send a RDY_REQUEST message
  to be informed by an ADC_RDY reply when the MISO/RDY pin goes low.

  This can operate on one register per job.

  This can perform big-endian translation on read and write.

  There are four modes.

      RESET MODE
          This does not require a register number or a value.

      READ MODE
          This accepts a single register number and sends the little endian
          value in the reply.

          Note that a READ of the the data register is deferred until the
          end of conversion.


      WRITE MODE
          This accepts a register number and a little endian value.

      BUFFERED MODE
          This accepts a buffer and a length. The buffer should contain
          the comms byte followed by the register value, which can be
          repeated as required, indicated by the length. The values are
          big endian.
