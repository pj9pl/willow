  HVPP

  The HVPP task is the High Voltage Parallel Programmer. It is hosted on York.

  The hvpp_info contains a lineno field. This indicates the offending line
  in the event of an EINVAL or EBADF client reply. 
  
  The avp(1) program is used to feed an aligned Intel hex file to HVPP.

  For example, from within the goat source directory, type:-

  $ avp -l 0xE2 -h 0xDA ../peru/image.hex
