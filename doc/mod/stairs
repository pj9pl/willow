  STAIRS

  The STAIRS task is an iterative process director that sets the MDAC to a
  value and then requests EGOR to perform a given number of measurements of
  that value. When EGOR has finished the value is incremented by a given
  stepsize and the process is repeated until the value reaches maximum.
