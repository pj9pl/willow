  TIMZ

  The TIMZ task is an iterative process director that reads the UTC from oslo
  and sends it to a destination in a DATE_NOTIFY message.

   This accepts START, STOP and SET_IOCTL messages where SIOC_SELECT_OUTPUT
   specifys:-
          0 = OFF
          1 = LCD (sumo)
          2 = OLED (jira)
          3 = OLED (peru)
          7 = GCALL (any/none)
  
   There is a heuristic one second interval that might indicate the
   relative inaccuracy of the internal RC oscillator.
