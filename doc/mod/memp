  MEMP

  The MEMP task is a network secretary provides remote write access to
  the host that it runs on.

  It receives a MEMP_REQUEST containing a host address, a source address,
  a destination address and a count value. It sends the source address and
  the count back to the host address in a MEMZ_REQUEST to read remote data
  into its local SRAM at the destination address. It then sends a MEMP_REPLY
  back to the caller with the number of bytes successfully transferred.
