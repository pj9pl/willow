  DUMP

  The DUMP task provides a remote memory dump service. It is an agent of CLI
  and is called in response to the command:-

        dump <host> [start_loc [+length | end_loc]]

  Usage:

      dump <host>
      dump <host> <start_loc>
      dump <host> <start_loc> <+length>
      dump <host> <start_loc> <end_loc>

  Dump the message buffer on fido specifying the length:-

      dump fido 106 +48

  or by specifying the end address:-

      dump fido 106 14d

  Note that the end_loc is inclusive. 

  If the +length and end_loc are both absent, an implicit 8ff is assumed:-

      dump fido 100

  If the start_loc is also absent an implicit 0 is assumed:-

      dump fido

  Dumping the system registers may cause malfunction as some may be altered in
  being read. The USART input data could be lost if the register is read by
  MEMZ instead of SER. This is possible because MEMZ reads from within the
  interrupt context.
