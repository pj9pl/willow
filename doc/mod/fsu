  FSU

  The FSU task is a file system utilities server. It is an intermediary between
  CLI on bali and FSD on oslo.

  The CLI sends the complete command line to the FSU which tokenizes it into
  an array of strings. The CLI specifies an opcode in the FSU_REQUEST that is
  one of:-

    OP_LS  ls
    OP_MV  mv
    OP_PWD pwd
    OP_RM  rm, rmdir
    OP_MK  create, mkdir
