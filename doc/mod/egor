  EGOR

  The EGOR task is an iterative process director. It reads measurement data
  from ALBA and sends it to various destinations. It accepts START and STOP
  messages, a destination selection message, and a loop count message.
  The ALBA setup number is incorporated into the measurement data for some
  destinations.

  The '<n> j' command sends the START (1j) and STOP (0j) messages to EGOR. 
  The measurement data consists of a 24-bit value, a 4-bit channel number
  and an 8-bit setup number. The complete measurement data is contained in
  a 5-byte structure.

  The data can be logged to a file on the oslo file system.
  This is controlled by the '<n> l' command, where <n> = [0..1].
  This has the effect of 0l = disable logging and 1l = enable logging.
  The data forms part of a 24-byte record in the file group egor[1..4].

  An additional destination can be set with the '<n> h' command, one of:-
     0h off
     1h VOLTAGEZ (sumo)
     3h OSTREAM  (peru)
     4h OSTREAM  (bali)
     5h VOLTAGEP (peru)
     7h GC       (peru,sumo)

  The loop count can be set with the '<n> r' command, where <n> = [0..65535].
  A value of 0 produces an infinite loop.

  A START message for a finite loop sends a reply when the loop count has
  been completed whereas for an infinite loop a reply is sent before the
  loop commences. This is because an infinite loop can only be stopped by
  a STOP message which would send its own reply. A STOP message to a finite
  loop is an unresolved anomaly. Currently, the reply is sent to the sender
  of the STOP message.
  
  The ALBA setup is controlled by the '<n> i' command, where <n> = [0..4].
  . output mtype can be set with:-
    send_SET_IOCTL(EGOR, SIOC_LOAD_PATCH, val);
  where val is in the range [32..36].
