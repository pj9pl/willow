  BCX

   The BCX task is a Bluetooth BC417 HC-05 manager.

   This driver manages three pins. Two inputs and one output.
   PIND3 (#5) - input  low = disconnected, high = connected.
   PIND4 (#6) - input  low = wake_up.
   PIND5 (#11) - output  high == enabled, low == disabled.

   Accepts status requests and produces a long reply containing the
   enabled and connected status as bit 3 (connected) and bit 5 (enabled).

   HC-05 adapters are a mixed bunch. Those that feature a BC352 don't respond
   to a low level on the ENABLE input, whereas those that feature a BC417 do.

   The current solution for BC352 adapters involves an external +5v VDD switch
   using an IRF9530, a 2N7000 and a 33k resistor.

   There are applications where disabling the HC-05 would be inappropriate.
   There should be the means to prevent the HC-05 from being disabled.
   The application can add -DHC_05_ALWAYS_ON to CFLAGS. This permits the
   removal of the wake_up button and the enable output, freeing-up two pins in
   the process. The HC-05 STATUS is enhanced, as it is now constant, and not
   subject to the HC-05 ENABLE condition. A saving of 248 code bytes too.
