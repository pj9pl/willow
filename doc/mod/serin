  SERIN

  The SERIN task is a USART consumer that receives NOT_EMPTY messages from
  the SER task and greedily collects characters into lines. When a newline
  is read the line is sent to Bali's OSTREAM task.

  Its purpose is to deliver the response from the HC-05 adapter to the gateway
  when the HC-05 is in command mode.

  It is enabled by a '1C' inp command and disabled by a '0C' inp command which
  directs the SER task to either send the NOT_EMPTY messages to either SERIN or
  INP.
