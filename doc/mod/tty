  TTY

  The TTY task provides a functional interface to a character buffer which
  is then sent to an OSTREAM secretary at a selected destination.
  It does not overwrite characters that are waiting to be sent.

  The functional interface:-

        PUBLIC void tty_putc(char ch);
        PUBLIC void tty_flush(void);
        PUBLIC void tty_puts(char *s);
        PUBLIC void tty_puts_P(PGM_P str);
        PUBLIC void tty_puthex(uchar_t ch);
        PUBLIC void tty_printl(long n);
        PUBLIC uchar_t tty_can_xmt (void);

  The control interface:-

        send_SET_IOCTL(TTY, SIOC_SELECT_OUTPUT, arg);
              where arg is one of 0 = SER, 1 = GATEWAY, 2 = SPI_OLED.

        send_SET_IOCTL(TTY, SIOC_OMODE, arg);
              where arg is one of OMODE_COOKED, OMODE_RAW.


  The tty functions are useful for debugging as they can be inserted into
  a state machine without altering the course of events.  By the same token,
  they should also be removable without altering the course of events.
