  CONSOLE

  The CONSOLE task is a network secretary that accepts OSTREAM_REQUEST
  messages and presents them on an OLED screen as a series of lines.
  
  This waits for an OSTREAM_REQUEST message containing a string to arrive via
  the TWI, and then sends the string to the OLED device, manipulating the
  LINESTART_SETTING and y position to simulate a scrolling screen. A cursor
  maintains the current insertion point. Long lines are wrapped. A newline
  character moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line. A newline
  at the lastline causes the screen to scroll up.
