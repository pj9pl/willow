  KEYEXEC

  The KEYEXEC task is a process director task that receives issues READ
  messages to KEYPAD and receives BUTTON_CHANGE messages when the transition
  occurs.

  It contains a 16-element table corresponding to the up and down transitions
  of eight buttons. When a BUTTON_CHANGE message is received, a message is
  sent to the SETUPD secretary on pisa to load a particular patchfile.

  KEYEXEC is initialized by KEYCONF which provides button associations.

  BUTTON_CHANGE actions are ignored whilst a SETUPD request is in progress.
