  BMP

  The BMP task is a device driver for a BOSCH BMP180 digital pressure sensor.

  Refer to BOSCH datasheet BST-BMP180-DS000-09.pdf r2.5 April 2015.

  The bmp_info fields are populated with the current readings in Pascals and
  tenths of a degree, Celsius.

   The client provides a pointer to a bmp_info structure which is populated
   with the calibrated values prior to the reply.
  
    
    typedef struct _bmp_info {
        struct _bmp_info *nextp;   
        ProcNumber replyTo;
        long T; /* Temperature in hundredths of a centigrade. */
        long p; /* Pressure in pascals. */
        unsigned mode : 1;
    } bmp_info;
    
    ...
    static bmp_info bmp;
    ...
    bmp.mode = READ_BMP;
    send_JOB(BMP, &bmp);
    ...
    case REPLY_RESULT:
         if (m_ptr->sender == BMP && m_ptr->RESULT == EOK) {
             tty_printl(bmp.T);
             tty_putc(',');
             tty_printl(bmp.p);
             tty_putc('\n');
         }
