  MV

  The MV task is a file system utility to move one or more directory items.

  syntax: mv src [...] dst

  - If dst exists and is a directory, a link is created between src and
    dst/src, then src is unlinked.
    There can be more than one src items.

  - If dst exists and is a regular file, dst is unlinked and a link is created
    between src and dst, with src being renamed as dst. Then src is unlinked.
    There can only be a single src.
    An attempt to move more than a single item to a regular file will generate
    an EPERM result value.

  - If dst does not exist, a link is created between src and dst, with src
    being renamed as dst. Then src is unlinked.
    There can only be a single src.
    The dst name must not be longer than NAME_SIZE.
    An attempt to move more than a single item to a non-existant item will
    generate an EPERM result value.

  - If src is a directory, src must not be in the path of dst as this would
    create a loop which would render dst inaccessible.
    An attempt to move a src to a subdirectory of src generates an EPERM
    result value.

  - If src is a regular file and dst is the same directory that contains src,
    nothing is done.
    An attempt to do this will generate an EPERM result value.

  - The root directory cannot be moved, as this would inevitably be to a
    subdirectory of itself.
    An attempt to do this will generate an EPERM result value.
