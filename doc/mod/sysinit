  SYSINIT

  The SYSINIT task performs the startup initialization. The hardware is
  configured then a list of tasks are each sent an INIT message.

  Within the main() function, a list of config_XXX() functions,
  The config_sysinit() function should be the first to be called in main(),
  as this disables all peripherals prior to subsequent enabling.
  Soft pullups are applied to unused pins.

  The dynamic initialization is initiated by sending an INIT message to the
  SYSINIT task prior to entering the main loop. This in turn sends an INIT
  message to each task listed in its init table, which places each network
  secretary into the twi pool so that remote requests can be serviced.

  The sysinit task is unusual in that the state variable is not an enum,
  but an index into a table.
