  MEMZ

  The MEMZ task is a network secretary that provides remote read access
  to the host SRAM in a combined transaction. The communication is unusual
  in that it is of variable length. It is initialized at start-up by the
  SYSINIT task and listens for a MEMZ_REQUEST message containing a 16-bit
  address and a 16-bit length, and returns that number of bytes from that
  address in a combined SR-ST transaction.

  The client must provide the storage for both the request and reply.

  Reserved I/O memory addresses are read as 0xB8 for some reason.
  It would appear that the interrupt context has some bearing, as
  dumping bali via the TWI loopback does not execute from within the
  interrupt context, and they read as 0x00, or from 0xC7 to 0xFF, 0x30.

  This task violates the mutual exclusion and privacy of other tasks.
  Furthermore, reading some I/O locations can cause side effects.
  for example if MEMZ were to read the USART receive buffer (0xC6)
  when it contains an unread byte, the byte would be lost to the
  intended recipient. [p.200,621]
