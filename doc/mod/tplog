  TPLOG

  The TPLOG task is an iterative process director that reads the BMP180
  barometric sensor and writes the pressure and temperature measurements to
  the SDCard situated on oslo at six minute intervals until a STOP message
  is received.

  It receives an INIT message at start-up. If the bootloader switch is open,
  the process is started. If it is closed, the process is not started, but
  SYSINIT gets an EOK never the less.
