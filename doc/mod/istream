  ISTREAM

  The ISTREAM task is a network secretary that provides remote access to an
  INP task.

  When the INP task has read each character and received the EWOULDBLOCK
  return value, the ISTREAM task sends a reply to the caller and resumes
  its quiescent condition in waiting for the next request to arrive.

  It is implemented on each internal host as an alternative to the SER task
  which has no USART0 connection.
