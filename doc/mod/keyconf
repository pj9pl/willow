  KEYCONF

  The KEYCONF task reads a file and parses the contents. This file should
  contain only button associations and comments.

  A comment should have an octothorpe (#) character in the first column,
  and extends to the end of line.

  A button association is a comma separated value record with a 'B' in the
  as the first value, a key number as the second value, and a path as the
  third value. The path should correspond to an alba configuration file.

  For example:-

  # etc/key/basic
  B,1,/alba/0-noise
  B,2,/alba/0-peru
  B,3,/alba/patch2
  B,4,/alba/patch3
  B,5,/alba/patch4
  B,6,/alba/patch5
  B,7,/alba/patch6
  B,8,/alba/patch7

  The path is resolved to an inode number then the button number and the
  inode number are sent to KEYEXEC.
