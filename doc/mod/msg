  MSG

  The MSG module declares the central fifo buffer through which all internal
  messages flow. A message is eight bytes long. A message is inserted into
  the buffer via one of five send_m?() functions, and extracted using the
  extract_msg() function.

  To dump the SRAM out of the USART0 peripheral if the Watchdog timer expires,
  #define WDT_DUMP 1
  in [app]/host.h.
