  LS

  The LS task is a utility that lists the items in the file system hierarchy.

  It is situated on iowa and is accessed via the FSU DO_LS request.
  The FSU pulls the argument string from bali's cli into a buffer and
  presents a tokenized representation of it to ls in its info structure.

  Usage:-

      ls [-ail] [item] ...

  The flags consist of:-

      -a   print all items including . and ..
      -i   print inode number
      -l   long form
