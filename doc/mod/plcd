  PLCD

  The PLCD task is a device driver for a parallel-connected LCD display.

  The PLCD is assisted by a cache and a number of secretaries.
  DATEZ, PRESSZ, TEMPERZ, VOLTAGEZ and BATTERYZ accept requests from
  any twi host.

  The secretary then transcribes the information into a job which is queued
  at the cache which transcribes differences into a series of PLCD jobs.
