  PUT

  The PUT task is a subsidiary command of the CLI. It is used to transfer a
  text file from the external environment to the current working directory
  of the SD card on oslo.

  The PHP script 'putfile' can be used to perform the operation and coordinate
  the EOF marker.

  The CLI 'put' command is of the form :-

    put -t filename keyword

  or :-

    put filename keyword

  A -t causes the file to be truncated before writing.

  The maximum line length is 256 bytes.

  The task emits a '.' without a newline to prompt the user to enter a line.
  When the line has been entered, the user waits until it receives a '.'
  before entering the next line.

  A line beginning with the keyword causes the task to terminate.
  The remainder of the line is discarded.
