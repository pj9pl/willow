  OSTREAM

  The OSTREAM task is a network secretary that accepts an OSTREAM_REQUEST
  message and then fetches data from the caller and sends it to the SER output.

  OSTREAM operates in lockstep with SER, and is unavailable until SER has
  completed. This unavailability is expressed as an EAGAIN error being
  returned in the reply to a failed request from another client, who should
  try again later.
