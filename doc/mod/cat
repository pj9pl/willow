  CAT

  The CAT task is a cli utility that transfers a file from the SDcard on oslo
  to the serial output on bali.

  Usage: cat [offset] path

  The optional offset argument specifies the starting position.

  Upon completion a single line report is printed that specifies the exit
  status and the final file position. This file position can be specified
  as the offset in subsequent cat operations.

  A single buffer is used to read from the file server and write to the USART.
  This achieves half the potential throughput in order to provide a window of
  opportunity to other TWI operations, in keeping with the principles of
  cooperative coexistance.
