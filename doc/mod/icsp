  ICSP

  The ICSP task is an in-circuit serial programmer. It is available on both
  bali and iowa, which allows access to all hosts. It can be used to program
  the application, bootloader, fuses and lock bits, via the SPI whilst the
  target device is held in reset.

  The target's bootloader switch can be a source of confusion. When it is
  closed, the target is directed into the bootloader main loop when bali's
  ICSP releases the /RESET pin. When it is open the target executes the
  application, if it exists.

  The bt_tee_sender.sh script executes in the sending terminal.
  This maintains the bluetooth connection during the operation.

  The avp(1) program is used to feed an Intel hex file to ICSP.

  For example, from within bali or iowa source directory, type:-

  $ (cd ../peru && make avp)
