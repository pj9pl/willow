Goat is an application for the ATmega328P microcontroller.
Goat is a stand-alone parallel programmer with a zero insertion force socket.

All the pins are required by the parallel interface, leaving none available
to control the HC-05 nor the external reset. Consequently, the HC-05 LED
should be flashing rapidly from when the power is applied, inviting a
connection. Also, there is no 'q' command, so the reset button must be
pressed prior to 'make flash'.

To build, enter :-
. ./defs.sh && make clean && make

To install the firmware in the ATmega328P, first establish a connection with
the Goat's HC-05. The linux /dev/rfcommX may not exist. The blueman-applet
 'Devices' dialog can be used to associate 'Goat' with a serial port.

The current adapter named 'Goat', is a type ZS-040, ID 98:D3:A1:F5:CD:D0.

To connect with  first of all enter :-

. ./defs.sh

This exports $logfileprefix, $tmpdir, $port and $PORT to the environment.

Its HC-05 LED should be flashing at a rapid 50% duty cycle. Enter :-

bt_tee_sender.sh.

Ensure that bt_tee_receiver.sh is not executing.

 - close BLSWITCH
 - press RESET

enter :-
make flash

If avrdude responds with 10 attempts in quick succession, check that $port
is set in the environment, and corresponds with the output of rfcomm(1).

Try:-
   . ./defs.sh
   make flash

If avrdude responds with 10 attempts in slow succession, press the
black RESET button.

If avrdude completed successfully, the updated application will now be
running, and bt_tee_receiver.sh can be executed in a separate terminal.
Confirmation can be obtained by entering an 'e' in the bt_tee_sender.sh
terminal and observe an ident response in the bt_tee_receiver.sh terminal.

# Operation

Commands should be listed in README.commands although inp.c is where they are
defined.

The linux avp(1) binary is designed to work with goat.
